# SchoolSite
This is the White Oaks Computer Science Webpage.
I run a computer science club at my school and I created this webpage to attract new members but to also make the lives of the students a lot easier.
On this site I upload the weekly slideshows, lessons, problems, and other events.
I use this site primarily to help the members stay on track from school and at home.
